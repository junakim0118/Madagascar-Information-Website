      <p>“I dont know if you have noticed, but there is a common theme embedded across your journey!
        Diversity!
        Chameleons who can change body colours, rainforests that house a variety of organisms, survival items that do
        not
        really go hand in hand, and us, planners who come from different cultural and academic backgrounds that have
        come
        together to work for the same goal!”</p>
      <img src="img/treasure02.gif" class="treasurebox">
      <p>We find ourselves surrounded by diversities in so many different contexts, yet, we often struggle to fully
        embrace
        the differences. Racial injustice, gender inequality, healthcare disparities due to differences in socioeconomic
        status are all examples of what is happening in the society right now due to lack of inclusivity. </p>
      <p>We hope you,
        the
        future leaders of the next chapter, have learned about what diversity looks like and gained insights into
        understanding its impact.</p>
